This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios
# using npm and specific device
npm run ios --device "iPhone 16 Pro"

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Step 4: Publishing your App

### For Android

Pre-req.: Follow the instructions here to setup upload key: https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android
1. Bump the version and/or build number in `~/android/app/build.gradle`
2. Run `npx react-native build-android --mode=release` in the console
3. The generated AAB can be found under `~/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`, and is ready to be uploaded to Google Play; where it can be used as a release or beta test build

### For iOS

1. Open iOS project in Xcode
2. Bump the version and/or build number under the General settings on the main app target
3. In the menu, go to "Product", then "Archive"
4. Once built successfully, the new version will show in the Organizer; select it
5. Click "Distribute App" and follow the wizard
6. To app will be uploaded to App Store Connect, where it can be used as a release or beta test build

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully ran, modified, and published your React Native App. :partying_face:
